# Buggy Data Base
A program to (....)

Welcome!

I made this project for a class called (....) using (....), during the first year of my Computer Science and Engineering degree.

The interaction with the program is made through input lines that contain a certain command as the first input string and the rest follows some rules, regarding the input (everything is explained in the file_system.pdf file).

The commands are:
- 'help': prints the available commands
- 'quit': terminates the program
- 'set': adds or modifies a stored value
- 'print': prints all the paths and values
- 'find': given a path, prints it's value 
- 'list': lists all the components of a path
- 'search': given a value, prints it's path
- 'delete': deletes a path and all it's subpaths

Hope you enjoy it!

Best wishes, Pedro Curto
