# Buggy Data Base
This is a simple didactic project for a class called Foundations of Programming that I made during the first year of my Computer Science and Engineering degree,
to get familiarized with core concepts and programming.

It is supposed to identify and fix the problems of a buggy database, which contains several problems, using Python:
- Fixing documentation
- Finding the database PIN
- Check data coherence
- Decrypting the content
- And debugging passwords

This is all explained in the statement (pdf).

Hope you enjoy it!

Best wishes, Pedro Curto
